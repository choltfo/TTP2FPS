Notes for TTP2FPS:

Recoil:
Recoil is a 3 dimensional vector that is held in the Combatant Entity. The Z-component is ignored if the character is grounded. Otherwise,
it applies some force to the character in the local -Z direction. The X and Y axes need to be divided by some dampening factor.
This is to be added later on.
